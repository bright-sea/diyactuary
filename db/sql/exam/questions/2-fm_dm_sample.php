<p>Happy Jalapenos, LLC has an exclusive contract to supply jalapeno peppers to the organizers of the annual jalapeno eating contest. The contract states that the contest organizers will take delivery of 10,000 jalapenos in one year at the market price. It will cost Happy Jalapenos 1,000 to provide 10,000 jalapenos and today's market price is 0.12 for one jalapeno. The continuously compounded risk-free interest rate is 6%.</p>
<p>Happy Jalapenos has decided to hedge as follows (both options are one-year, European):</p>
<p>Buy 10,000 0.12-strike put options for 84.30 and sell 10,000 0.14-stike call options for 74.80.</p>

<p>The accumulated cost of the hedge is (84.30-74.80)exp(.06) = 10.09.<br>
Let x be the market price.<br>
If x < 0.12 the put is in the money and the payoff is 10,000(0.12 - x) = 1,200 - 10,000x.<br>
The sale of the jalapenos has a payoff of 10,000x - 1,000 for a profit of 1,200 - 10,000x + 10,000x - 1,000 - 10.09 = 190.<br>
From 0.12 to 0.14 neither option has a payoff and the profit is 10,000x - 1,000 - 10.09 = 10,000x - 1,010.<br>
If x >0.14 the call is in the money and the payoff is -10,000(x - 0.14) = 1,400 - 10,000x.<br>

<p>This is based on Exercise 3.18 on <b>Page 89</b>. <br>
To see that D does not produce the desired outcome, begin with the case where the stock price is S and is below 90. The payoff is S + 0 + (110 - S) - 2(100 - S) = 2S - 90 which is not constant and so cannot produce the given diagram. <br>
On the other hand, for example, answer E has a payoff of S + (90 - S) + 0 - 2(0) = 90. The cost is 100 + 0.24 + 2.17 - 2(6.80) = 88.81. With interest it is 93.36. The profit is 90 - 93.36 = -3.36 which matches the diagram. </p>

<p>The put premium has future value (at t=.5) of 74.20 * (1+(.04/2)) = 75.68<br>

These two profits are opposites (naturally, since long and short positions have opposite payoff and profit). <br>
Thus, they can only be equal if producing 0 profit. 0 profit is only obtained if 75.68 = max(1,000-S.5,0), or 1,000-S.5 = 75.68, or S.5 = 924.32.</p>

<p>Buying a call, in conjunction with a short position in a stock index, is a form of insurance called a cap.<br>
Answers (A) and (B) are incorrect because they relate to a floor, which is the purchase of a put to insure against a long position in a stock index.<br>
Answer (E) is incorrect because it relates to writing a covered call, which is the sale of a call along with a long position in the stock index, so that the investor is selling rather than buying insurance.<br>
Note that a cap can also be thought of as 'buying' a covered call. </p>
<p>Now, let's calculate the profit:<br>
2-year profit = payoff at time 2 - the future value of the initial cost to establish the position<br>

<p>This consists of standard applications of the put-call parity equation on p.69.<br>
Let C be the price for the 40-strike call option. Then, C + 3.35 is the price for the 35-strike call option.<br>
Similarly, let P be the price for the 40-strike put option. Then, P - x is the price for the 35-strike put option, where x is what we're trying to find. <br>
Using put-call parity, we have:<br>
(C + 3.35) + 35*e\(^{-.02}\) - 40 = P - x (this is for the 35-strike options)<br>
C + 40*e\(^{-.02}\) - 40 = P (this is for the 40-strike options)<br>
Subtracting the first equation from the second, 5*e\(^{-.02}\) - 3.35 = x = 1.55.</p>

<div class="QuestionSolution">
<p>The initial cost to establish this position is 5*2.78 - 3*6.13 = -4.49. <br>
Thus, you are receiving 4.49 up front. This grows to 4.49*e.08*.25 = 4.58 after 3 months. <br>

The second is a 'strangle' consisting of a 35-strike put and a 45-strike call. For what range of stock prices in 3 months does the 'strangle' outperform the 'straddle'?</p>
<div class="QuestionContent">

<input type="radio" name="questionOption" value="5" /><span class="QuestionOptionSign">(E)</span>The 'strangle' always outperforms the 'straddle.'
</div>

<div class="QuestionSolution">
<p>The 'straddle' consists of buying a 40-strike call and buying a 40-strike put. This costs 2.78 + 1.99 = 4.77 at t=0, and grows to 4.77*e\(^{.02}\) = 4.87 at t=.25.<br>
The 'strangle' consists of buying a 35-strike put and a 45-strike call. This costs 0.44 + 0.97 = 1.41 at t=0, and grows to 1.41*e\(^{.02}\) = 1.44 at t=.25. <br>
For ST<40, the 'straddle' has a profit of 40-ST-4.87 = 35.13, and for ST>=40, the 'straddle' has a profit of ST-40-4.87 = 44.87. <br>
For ST<35, the 'strangle' has a profit of 35-ST-1.44 = 33.56, and for ST>45, the 'strangle' has a profit of ST-45-1.44 = 46.44. <br>
However, for 35\(\le ST \le\)45, the 'strangle' has a profit of -1.44 (since both options would not be exercised). <br>
Comparing the payoff structures between the 'straddle' and 'strangle', we see that if ST<35 or if ST>45, the 'straddle' would outperform the 'strangle' (since 35.13 > 33.56, and since -44.87 > -46.44).<br>
However, if 35\(\le ST \le\)45, we can solve for the two cutoff points for ST, where the 'strangle' would outperform the 'straddle' as follows: -1.44 > 35.13 - ST, and -1.44 > ST - 44.87.<br>
The first inequality gives ST > 36.57, and the second inequality gives ST < 43.43. Thus, 36.57 < ST < 43.43.</p>

<p>This is an example of pricing a forward contract using discrete dividends.<br>
Thus, we need the future value of the current stock price minus the future value of each of the 12 dividends, where the valuation date is T=3.<br>
Thus, the valuation equation is: Forward price = \(200*e^{.04(3)} - [1.50*e^{.04(2.75)} + 1.50*1.01*e^{.04(2.5)} + 1.50*(1.01)^2*e^{.04(2.25)} + \cdot \cdot\cdot 1.50*(1.01)^{12}] = 200*e^{.12} - 1.50*e^{.11}{[1-(1.01*e^{-.01})^{12}]/[1-(1.01*e^{.01})]}\), using the geometric series formula from interest theory. <br>

Then, we must solve for the level swap price, which is labeled x below, as follows:<br>
\(4,562.49 = \frac{x}{1.05} + \frac{x}{(1.055)^2} + \frac{x}{(1.06)^3} = x*[\frac{1}{1.05} + \frac{1}{(1.055)^2} + \frac{1}{(1.06)^3}] = 2.69045*x\). <br>

<p>Thus, the fixed swap rate = R = [(.96154)*(.04)+...+(.69656)*(.12649)] / [.96154 +...+.69656]<br>
= [.03846 + .04580 + .05803 + .07303 + .08811]/[.96154 + .91573 + .85770 + .78466 +.69656]<br>
= .30344 / 4.21619 = .07197 = 7.20% (approximately).</p>
<p>[Note: This is much less calculation-intensive if you realize that the numerator (.30344) for R can also be obtained by taking 1- P(0,n) = 1 - P(0,5) = 1 - .69656 = .30344. Then, you would not need to calculate any of the implied forward rates!]</p>

<p>The dividend yield on a stock (d) and the interest rate used to discount the stock's cash flows (r) are both continuously compounded. There are 4 alternative methods to buy a stock: outright purchase, fully leveraged purchase, prepaid forward contract, and forward contract. The dividend yield is less than the interest rate, but both are positive. Which of the following is the correct ranking, from smallest to largest, for the amount of payment needed to acquire the stock?</p>
<p>Note: in establishing your ranking, you should calculate each payment amount at the exact time of payment, so that for any methods that have payment times in the future, you do not need to discount these payments back to time-0 when comparing amounts.</p>

<div class="QuestionSolution">
<p>If \(S_0\) is the price of the stock at time-0, then the following payments are required:<br>
Outright purchase - payment at time 0 - amount of payment = \(S_0\).<br>
Fully leveraged purchase - payment at time T - amount of payment = \(S_0*e^{rT}\).<br>
Prepaid forward contract - payment at time 0 - amount of payment = \(S_0*e^{-dT}\).<br>
Forward contract - payment at time T - amount of payment = \(S_0*e^{(r-d)T}\).<br>
Since r>d>0, it must be true that \(S_0*e^{-dT} < S_0 < S_0*e^{(r-d)T} < S_0*e^{rT}\).
Thus, the correct ranking is given by choice (A).</p>
